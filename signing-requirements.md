### Requirement #1: Registry Operator Differentiated Value

Registry operators must be able to leverage other systems within their product and service lines. Specifically, the spec must allow for:

- External key management - leveraging other services they may provide
- Blob storage - leveraging unique cloud provider storage solutions
- Integrated authentication and authorization - while the spec must account for auth flows, each cloud provider must be able to provide flows that incorporate 2FA and service accounts.
